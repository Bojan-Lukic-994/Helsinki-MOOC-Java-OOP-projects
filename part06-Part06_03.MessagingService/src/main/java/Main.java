/*
The exercise template comes with a pre-defined Message class that can be used to create objects representing messages. 
Each message has a sender and some content.

Implement the MessagingService class. The class must have a parameterless constructor and contain a list of Message objects. 
After that, add the following two methods to the class:
- public void add(Message message) - adds a message passed as a parameter to the messaging service 
as long as the message content is at most 280 characters long.
- public ArrayList<Message> getMessages() - returns the messages added to the messaging service.

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Try out your class here
        
    }
}
