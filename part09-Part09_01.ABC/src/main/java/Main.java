PART1: Create the following three classes:

Class A. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void a(), which prints a string "A".
Class B. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void b(), which prints a string "B".
Class C. Class should have no object variables nor should you specify a constructor for it. It only has the method public void c(), which prints a string "C".
